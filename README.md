# bgrestore

bgrestore.sh helps you automatically restore the last successful full backup from bgbackup to another MariaDB server. This is very useful for verifying backups, refreshing development environments, etc.

bgrestore connects to the backup_history table in mdbutil to find the last successful full backup for a given host. It then delegates the actual restore (decrypt, decompress, prepare, move-back) to [fgrestore](../mysql-mariadb-physical-backup/files/fgrestore.sh), which needs to be installed alongside bgrestore on the restore host. bgrestore itself only keeps what's genuinely its own: the backup_history lookup, logging/mail, and stopping/starting the MariaDB service around the restore.

## How to...

This all assumes the backup was taken with bgbackup (https://github.com/bstillman/bgbackup). This is necessary for the script to gather the required information.

Copy bgrestore.cnf.dist to /etc/bgrestore.cnf and configure as needed (details below). To run restore tests against a multi-instance host, copy it to a distinct path per instance instead and select it with `bgrestore -c /path/to/that/instance's/bgrestore.cnf`.

There are two ways to get the backup onto the server to be restored, controlled by `skipcopy`:

* **`skipcopy=yes`** (local storage): something else -- typically `copy-last-backup.sh` from the [mysql-mariadb-physical-backup](../mysql-mariadb-physical-backup) role, run via bgbackup's `run_after_success` hook -- has already transferred the backup, along with its full dependency chain (Full + any Differential/Incremental in between), into `preppath` as one subdirectory per chain member. bgrestore picks whichever member is newest under `preppath` and restores it **in place** (`fgrestore -I`) -- no second copy.
* **`skipcopy=no`** (shared storage, e.g. the same mount point on both servers): bgrestore has fgrestore copy the chain from `backup_history`'s recorded location into `preppath` itself before preparing it.

Either way, fgrestore resolves the chain from each member's own `bgbackup.cnf` (its `incbase=` pointer). If a chain was relocated as a group -- as `skipcopy=yes` mode does, moving it onto a different host under a different parent directory -- and a literal `incbase=` path no longer exists, the chain walk falls back to looking for a same-named directory next to the one it's currently walking, so a relocated chain still resolves correctly without any `bgbackup.cnf` needing to be rewritten.


------------------------------------

## Configuration Options

### restorehost

The hostname or IP address of the MariaDB server to be restored. 

### restoreport

The port of the MariaDB server to be restored. 

### restoreuser

The database user on the MariaDB server to be restored. Needs the shutdown privilege.

### restorepass

The password for the restoreuser database user. 

### preppath

The path the backup will be copied to for decompression and decryption if necessary. Be sure this path has enough free space for the decompressed backup. 

### backuphisthost

The hostname or IP address of the MariaDB server with the backup_history table. 

### backuphistport

The port of the MariaDB server with the backup_history table. 

### backuphistuser

The database user with at least select privilege on the backup_history table. 

### backuphistpass

The password for the backuphistuser database user. 

### backuphistschema

The name of the schema/database which the backup_history table resides. 

### backuphost

The hostname of the server from which the backup was taken. Ex. If backing up server1 and restoring to server2, this is the hostname of server1 as found in backup_history. 

### datadir

The full path to the data directory on the MariaDB server to be restored. 

### restore_my_cnf_file

The my.cnf fgrestore should use for the restore. Parses datadir, tmpdir, innodb log/doublewrite dirs, log-error/log-bin/relay-log paths, and the owning `user=` (fgrestore chowns restored files to whatever `user=` says there, default mysql, if it's not set).

### service_name

The systemd service name to stop/start around the restore. Defaults to `mariadb`; set per-instance (via a distinct config file selected with `-c`) to run restore tests against a multi-instance host.

### logpath

The full path to where the log files should be written. 

### syslog

Setting to yes will log to file and syslog.

### threads

The number of threads innobackupex should use for decryption and/or decompression. 

### maillist

A comma separated list of email address to send the logfile to when complete. 

### mailsubpre

A prefix for email subject lines. 

### mailon

Set to all to email after each run successful or not. Set to failure to only email on failures.
